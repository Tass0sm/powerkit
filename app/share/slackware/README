powerkit is a lightweight full featured power manager created for Slackware for use with alternative desktop environments and window managers, like Fluxbox, Blackbox, FVWM, WindowMaker, Openbox, Lumina and others.

Hibernation requires the kernel option resume=<swap_partition/swap_file> added to the boot loader configuration. Back light support requires proper udev rules, see /usr/doc/powerkit-VERSION/90-backlight.rules.
